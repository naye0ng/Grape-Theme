Aah, so basically I had this issue going on with my ubuntu where I can't control the keyboard backlight. People around my workspace was also getting annoyed seeing flashy lights from all over the keyboard. I searched a lot online for a solution, but sadly I couldn't find a working one. Today I luckily found one.

If this [link](https://github.com/wroberts/rogauracore) doesn't work try [this](https://github.com/JoshDreamland/rogauracore/archive/retool.zip) one. 

After downloading and extracting it to the home folder
run these

```
cd rogauracore-retool
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
Hope it works for you!!
